This DVD contains all of the rpm updates to RHEL 8 since the final DVD release of 8.10 up to <date>

In order to use this as a repo, a repofile needs to be created in /etc/yum.repos.d which can be done with the included script make_repo_file.sh
To create your own repofile, see make_repo_file.sh for a reference

=======================================================
Following is a summary of how this DVD was made:
=======================================================

Download all of the updates since 1/1/24 on a RHEL 8 box that is subscribed to BaseOS:
dnf download $(dnf repoquery --qf '%{buildtime} %{name}' | sort | grep -E '^2024|^2025' | awk '{print $3}'| sort -u | tr '\n' ' ')
OPTIONAL:  Mount the build cd and compared the files, removing duplicates to reduce size.
for i in $(ls <path_to_iso>/BaseOS/Packages/*.rpm) ; do ls <path_to_rpms> | grep -w $i >> /tmp/duplicates ; done
for i in $(cat duplicates) ; do rm -f <path_to_rpms>/$i ; done
AppStream contains no updates, so no need to compare those directories/repos

Make the repo:
createrepo <path_to_rpms>

Make the iso:
mkisofs -o <path_to_iso_name>.iso -joliet-long <path_to_rpms>
